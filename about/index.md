Currently working for a software company called [Capgemini Polska](http://www.pl.capgemini.com/) in [Software Solutions Center](http://www.pl.capgemini-sdm.com/) in Wroclaw. 

Technical architect and software engineer in a wide variety of business applications for global customers from the logistic and sales area, with over 12 years of professional experience in designing and developing JEE systems to deal with complex, frequently changing, requirements. Engaged in developing and integration of technical basis for a few big JEE systems.

Open Source enthusiast and architect. Engaged in activities in ASF projects: Karaf and ServiceMix. My goal is to make the open source way successful. In my opinion, the business applications should take from open source as much technical knowledge as possible, but also should give open source communities as much technical knowledge as possible (in contrary to the business knowledge, which is a private value of customers)

Particularly interested in development of scalable, performant and robust integrations systems based on integration products from the Apache Software Foundation (ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and ServiceMix), Red Hat (the commercial JBoss Fuse, formerly Fuse ESB, and it's free open source equivalent Fabric8) and Oracle (Oracle Service Bus).

 * AOP (AspectJ, Spring AOP),
 * configuration & build management (Maven, Nexus, GIT, SVN, Tycho, Hudson/Jenkins),
